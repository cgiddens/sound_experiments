TODO:
 [ ] Add clipping
 [ ] Figure out: do I need to protect from aliasing?
 [ ] Add GUI
 [ ] Add MIDI and/or keyboard input
 [ ] Integrate into nih-plug?

FUTURE IDEAS:
 [ ] Hard sync
 [ ] Filters
 [ ] EQ
 [ ] Resonators
 [ ] Physical modeling (Karplus-Strong, resonating body)

DONE:
 [x] Create single wavetable oscillator
 [x] Add single modulator input
 [x] Implement phase modulation algorithm
 [x] Migrate oscillator to graph node; implement data transfer on edges
 [x] Add support for one-to-many, many-to-one
